This visualization shows the total surplus value realized by each team in each draft year. This valuation is <i>not</i> adjusted for the number of picks the team has, but it <i>is</i> adjusted for the specific pick. For instance, if a team with the 15th pick was expected to get a value of 10 but realized a value of 11 with the player they chose, they would have a realized a surplus of five. Negative values imply the team got less value than expected; positive values imply the team got more value.
