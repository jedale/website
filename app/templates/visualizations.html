		<li><a href="{{ url_for('vis_draft') }}">NFL Team Draft Performance</a>: I developed a rough metric to evaluate how well teams perform in selecting talent via the NFL draft, and then used a heatmap to visualize it for the entire league.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ url_for('vis_cap') }}">NFL Team Salary Cap Usage</a>: Using the squarify algorithm, I developed a treemap visualization of how NFL teams use their salary cap space. Warning: Work in progress, currently only a demonstration for the 2017 Seahawks is available.
